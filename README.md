# Albion Dungeon Scanner

This project, named Albion Dungeon Scanner, is a dungeon scanner developed in Python. It is inspired by the NJTools project, originally written in C#.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or a later version installed.
- Internet access for dependency downloads.

1. Install PDM by following the instructions on [the official PDM website](https://pdm-project.org/latest/#recommended-installation-method).

2. Run the following command in the root of the albion-dungeon-scanner folder to install the project's dependencies:
   ```bash
   pdm install
   ```

3. Rename the `.env.base` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary information.
   For example, set the "ao-dir" to the path of your game directory:
   ```yaml
   "ao-dir": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Albion Online\\game\\" 
   ```

4. After installation, enter a dungeon and execute the following command in the root of the albion-dungeon-scanner folder to start the scanning process:
   ```bash
   pdm run scan
   ```
   If you change floors, rerun the command to update the information.

### Potential Improvements

- Automatic detection of dungeon entrances and floor changes through Photon events.
- ~~Local extraction of binaries to XML format.~~ Done
